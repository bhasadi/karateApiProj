âœ… 1. PowerShell (Recommended for Windows / VSCode Terminal)
powershell
Copy
$env:VAULT_TOKEN = "your-vault-token-here"
mvn test -Dtest=runners.MyRunner
This sets the env variable only for the current terminal session.

âœ… 2. CMD (Windows Command Prompt)
cmd
Copy
set VAULT_TOKEN=your-vault-token-here
mvn test -Dtest=runners.MyRunner
âœ… 3. Linux/macOS Bash or Git Bash
bash
Copy
export VAULT_TOKEN=your-vault-token-here
mvn test -Dtest=runners.MyRunner
âœ… 4. As part of the Maven command (inline)
Only works in Linux/macOS or Git Bash:

bash
Copy
VAULT_TOKEN=your-vault-token-here mvn test -Dtest=runners.MyRunner
For Windows CMD, this does not work. Use set or $env: as shown above.

âœ… 5. CI/CD Systems (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Jenkins)
In CI tools, define VAULT_TOKEN as a secured environment variable in the pipeline configuration or project secrets.

Let me know if you want a package.json NPM script version of this too.

pls write me this for usage in package.json

Certainly! Here's how you can structure your package.json to run Karate tests with a VAULT_TOKEN passed as an environment variable.

âœ… 1. Add a script in package.json
Update your package.json like this:

json
Copy
{
  "name": "karate-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "test:karate:vault": "set VAULT_TOKEN=your-vault-token-here && mvn test -Dtest=runners.MyRunner"
  }
}
âœ… Usage (in PowerShell or CMD on Windows):
bash
Copy
npm run test:karate:vault
ðŸ§ª Optional: Pass Vault Token dynamically from CLI
To avoid hardcoding VAULT_TOKEN, use an npm package like cross-env:

1. Install cross-env (if not already):
bash
Copy
npm install --save-dev cross-env
2. Update script to be cross-platform:
json
Copy
"scripts": {
  "test:karate:vault": "cross-env VAULT_TOKEN=your-vault-token-here mvn test -Dtest=runners.MyRunner"
}
This works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

3. Usage:
bash
Copy
npm run test:karate:vault
Or pass token dynamically:

bash
Copy
cross-env VAULT_TOKEN=my-token npm run test:karate:vault
Would you like to parameterize the environment (dev, sit, etc.) from package.json too?
